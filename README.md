# Web-Design_Challenge

Created a weather data website using HTML and CSS (Bootstrap).

It contains seven pages.  Four are scatter plot visualizations that compare Latitude to Maximum Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed from around the world. Each contains its own brief description.

Another page is a Comparison page that presents all four visualizations at once.

Finally, the final page is the Data page. It contains the data used to generate the visualizations, converted from a CSV file to HTML.
